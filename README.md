# HighCal

An R tool for the high-dimensional calibration method for log-contrast models subject to measurement errors.

## Usage
You first need to install R packages "MASS","glmnet","corpcor","lars" and "scalreg", then load "functions.R". We describe the data generation and how to conduct high-dimensional calibration method for given dataset in "main.R". After running the "main.R", you can obtain the point estimator, variance estimator and $p$-value of the high-dimensional calibration method.
